    "# Mathematical operations\n",
    "Earth Engine supports many basic mathematical operators. They share some common features. Earth Engine performs math operations per pixel. When an operator is applied to an image, it's applied to each unmasked pixel of each band. In the case of operations on two images, the operation is only applied at the locations where pixels in both images are unmasked. Earth Engine automatically matches bands between images. When an operator is applied to two images, the images are expected to have the same number of bands so they can be matched pairwise. However, if one of the images has only a single band, it is matched with all of the bands in the other image, essentially replicating that band enough times to match the other image."

    "## Install Earth Engine API and geemap\n",
    "Install the [Earth Engine Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install) and [geemap](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap). The **geemap** Python package is built upon the [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) and [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) packages and implements several methods for interacting with Earth Engine data layers, such as `Map.addLayer()`, `Map.setCenter()`, and `Map.centerObject()`.\n",
    "The following script checks if the geemap package has been installed. If not, it will install geemap, which automatically installs its [dependencies](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap#dependencies), including earthengine-api, folium, and ipyleaflet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: A key difference between folium and ipyleaflet is that ipyleaflet is built upon ipywidgets and allows bidirectional communication between the front-end and the backend enabling the use of the map to capture user input, while folium is meant for displaying static data only ([source](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-gis-in-jupyter-with-ipyleaflet-52f9657fa7a)). Note that [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) currently does not support ipyleaflet ([source](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/60#issuecomment-596225619)). Therefore, if you are using geemap with Google Colab, you should use [`import geemap.foliumap`](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/geemap/foliumap.py). If you are using geemap with [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or a local Jupyter notebook server, you can use [`import geemap`](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/geemap/geemap.py), which provides more functionalities for capturing user input (e.g., mouse-clicking and moving)."
