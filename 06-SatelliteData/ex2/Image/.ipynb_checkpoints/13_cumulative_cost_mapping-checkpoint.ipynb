    "# Cumulative Cost Mapping\n",
    "Use `image.cumulativeCost()` to compute a cost map where every pixel contains the total cost of the lowest cost path to the nearest source location. This process is useful in a variety of contexts such as habitat analysis ([Adriaensen et al. 2003](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204602002426)), watershed delineation ([Melles et al. 2011](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029611001691)) and image segmentation ([Falcao et al. 2004](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261076)). Call the cumulative cost function on an image in which each pixel represents the cost per meter to traverse it. Paths are computed through any of a pixel's eight neighbors. Required inputs include a `source` image, in which each non-zero pixel represents a potential source (or start of a path), and a `maxDistance` (in meters) over which to compute paths. The algorithm finds the cumulative cost of all paths less than maxPixels = `maxDistance`/scale in length, where scale is the pixel resolution, or [scale of analysis in Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale).\n",

    "## Install Earth Engine API and geemap\n",
    "Install the [Earth Engine Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install) and [geemap](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap). The **geemap** Python package is built upon the [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) and [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) packages and implements several methods for interacting with Earth Engine data layers, such as `Map.addLayer()`, `Map.setCenter()`, and `Map.centerObject()`.\n",
    "The following script checks if the geemap package has been installed. If not, it will install geemap, which automatically installs its [dependencies](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap#dependencies), including earthengine-api, folium, and ipyleaflet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: A key difference between folium and ipyleaflet is that ipyleaflet is built upon ipywidgets and allows bidirectional communication between the front-end and the backend enabling the use of the map to capture user input, while folium is meant for displaying static data only ([source](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-gis-in-jupyter-with-ipyleaflet-52f9657fa7a)). Note that [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) currently does not support ipyleaflet ([source](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/60#issuecomment-596225619)). Therefore, if you are using geemap with Google Colab, you should use [`import geemap.foliumap`](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/geemap/foliumap.py). If you are using geemap with [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or a local Jupyter notebook server, you can use [`import geemap`](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/geemap/geemap.py), which provides more functionalities for capturing user input (e.g., mouse-clicking and moving)."
