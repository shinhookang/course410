    "# Convolutions\n",
    "To perform linear convolutions on images, use `image.convolve()`. The only argument to convolve is an `ee.Kernel` which is specified by a shape and the weights in the kernel. Each pixel of the image output by `convolve()` is the linear combination of the kernel values and the input image pixels covered by the kernel. The kernels are applied to each band individually. For example, you might want to use a low-pass (smoothing) kernel to remove high-frequency information. The following illustrates a 15x15 low-pass kernel applied to a Landsat 8 image:"

    "## Install Earth Engine API and geemap\n",
    "Install the [Earth Engine Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install) and [geemap](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap). The **geemap** Python package is built upon the [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) and [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) packages and implements several methods for interacting with Earth Engine data layers, such as `Map.addLayer()`, `Map.setCenter()`, and `Map.centerObject()`.\n",
    "The following script checks if the geemap package has been installed. If not, it will install geemap, which automatically installs its [dependencies](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap#dependencies), including earthengine-api, folium, and ipyleaflet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: A key difference between folium and ipyleaflet is that ipyleaflet is built upon ipywidgets and allows bidirectional communication between the front-end and the backend enabling the use of the map to capture user input, while folium is meant for displaying static data only ([source](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-gis-in-jupyter-with-ipyleaflet-52f9657fa7a)). Note that [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) currently does not support ipyleaflet ([source](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/60#issuecomment-596225619)). Therefore, if you are using geemap with Google Colab, you should use [`import geemap.foliumap`](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/geemap/foliumap.py). If you are using geemap with [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or a local Jupyter notebook server, you can use [`import geemap`](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap/blob/master/geemap/geemap.py), which provides more functionalities for capturing user input (e.g., mouse-clicking and moving)."
